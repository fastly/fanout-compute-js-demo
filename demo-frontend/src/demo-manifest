## WebSockets

[WebSockets](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) allows browsers to keep an open data channel with
a server. This channel can be used to send and receive updates in real time, enhancing the user experience
with a sense of togetherness with other users.

Implementing WebSockets for an application has typically meant that the origin server must hold and maintain
all of these connections.

With Fastly Fanout and the open [WebSocket-Over-HTTP](https://pushpin.org/docs/protocols/websocket-over-http/) protocol,
Compute@Edge holds all of these WebSocket connections for you at the edge, so that your origin can focus on business logic.

The origin receives incoming WebSocket messages in the form of HTTP POST requests, and sends messages by making
its own HTTP requests to a publishing endpoint.
