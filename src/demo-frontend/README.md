### Fanout WebSockets Compute@Edge Demo: Demo Frontend Compute@Edge Application

This application is written in Rust and runs on Compute@Edge. It enables Fastly Fanout by forwarding all calls to the
`origin` application, upgrading WebSocket requests in the meantime.

Please see the [README.md](https://github.com/fastly/fanout-compute-js-demo) file at the root of the demo for details.
